# Pirate Speak!
**A Simon Says game where you translate the pirate words from your captain into landlubber lingo.** 

This game was made for the [K-jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/k-jam-2024) hosted by [DSAU](https://dsau.dk/) at Aarhus University. 
Art and sounds made by the wonderful [Victor B](https://victor-bund.itch.io/). 
I take no responsibility for headaches and other pains this terrible spaghetti code will cause.
